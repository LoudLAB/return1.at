Until now I have used `Dropbox`_ only to sync my `Keepass`_ database. It
has been a matter of common knowledge that Dropbox is transmitting data
over the net unencrypted, and also stores it likewise without
encryption. I have kept my business data in sync via `MobileMe`_ and
iDisk. This setup being somewhat unsatisfactory, I already had an eye on
`Wuala`_ for some time, but the price model was yet discouraging me. 

And in order to use Dropbox securely, a `Truecrypt`_ volume would have to be
synced, which would again take `special settings`_, so that not the
entire volume would be synced at every minimal change. 

Due to the
continuing `security issues`_ and the bold `security lie`_ on the part
of Dropbox, Wuala has now responded and provides all functionalities
including 1GB for free. That was what I had been waiting for. Quickly
MobileMe was terminated, Dropbox was deleted and replaced by Wuala.
There are clients for every platform, including iOS and Android. 

For
technicallyÂ proficient users, the switch should entail only advantages.
Admittedly, Dropbox has got the more intuitive interface, which may also
explain its previous success. But after the latest incidents, Dropbox
should be a no-go for everyone. 

Why Wuala is better than Dropbox can be
gathered sufficiently from the net, I will just pitch on the items that
appeal to me in particular:

-  local encryption of data, zero knowledge on the part of Wuala (i.e.
   if you forget the Wuala password, unsynced data is lost)
-  flexible file and folder syncing, not just one global folder like
   with Dropbox

Wuala has one drawback though: If a folder is shared with non-Wuala
contacts, a "secret" weblink is generated, through which the shared
folder's data can be seen. In order to be truly secure here, this link
would have to be sent to the recipients cryptographically, which is not
always possible. That means, 100% security is only feasible when sharing
happens between Wuala accounts. 

By all means I am well-pleased so far.
For obtaining a little more disk space there is a multitude of `promo
codes`_ that can easily be found with google.
