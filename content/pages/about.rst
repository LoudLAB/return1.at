About
#####

My name is Dominique Lederer. I have been developing web applications
since 1999/2000. From an early time on, as a company employee, I have
gained experience with corporate clients and projects, like for example
Telekom Austria, Allianz, o2 or Red Bull. After my extra-occupational
studies at FH Technikum Wien, study course ICSS, I have been working as
sole proprietor of an individual company since 2007, to keep the
stewardship of my work's quality within my own hands.

My job is to design, develop and maintain web applications, focusing on the use of
current and at the same time reliable technologies. To this end,
permanent education and training is the staff of life for me, to retain
the cutting edge.
